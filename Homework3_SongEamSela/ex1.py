after, and in its own niche the coding language has become just as famous and influential. 

The programming language was started as a side project by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, 
van Rossum was working on a distributed system at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the Dutch national 
research center for math and computer science. Frustrated by the inadequacies of existing programming languages, 
he decided to create a new one â€” one that would be both easy-to-use and capable. """
